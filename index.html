        <h3>
            <p>We celebrate our Independence Day on 15th August every year.<br>
                It is the day when we became independent from the foreign rule <br>
                after a long and continuous struggle for freedom. <br>
                Minister of India unfurls the National Flag over the Red Fort in Delhi on this day.<br>
                He also addresses the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on this day.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the flag hoisting, National Anthem is sung. A guard of honor <br>
                is presented by the Armed Forces, the Police and the N.C.C.,<br> 
                Similar functions are held in all the State capitals and important towns and
                cities.<br>
                A special tribute to all the brave soldiers who gave their life for our freedom</p>
